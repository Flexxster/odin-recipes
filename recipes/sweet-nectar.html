    <title>Sweet Nectar</title>
</head>
<body>
    This delicious drink is flavorful, nourishing, and surprisingly elegant when served in a tall glass. Get your produce during peak season; the quality of the fruit will make a huge difference in the taste.

2 cups fresh stone fruit (peaches or nectarines are ideal), peeled and sliced
Water
I Tbsp lemon juice
⅓ cup sugar (or more to taste, depending on the tartness of the fruit).
¼ to ½ tsp rosewater (optional)
Place the fruit in a large saucepan and add just enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil and then simmer until the fruit is soft enough to easily crush with a spoon, about 20-25 minutes. Add the lemon juice and sugar to the fruit mixture and let cool to room temperature.

Reserving the cooking liquid, strain out the fruit and place in a blender. Process until very smooth, then add the saved cooking liquid along with 2 more cups water and the rosewater if desired. Stir to combine and chill before serving.
