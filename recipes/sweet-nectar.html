        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <p>
        <li>2 cups fresh stone fruit (peaches or nectarines are ideal), peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>I Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sugar (or more to taste, depending on the tartness of the fruit).<li>
        <li>¼ to ½ tsp rosewater (optional)</li>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the fruit in a large saucepan and add just enough water to cover.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and then simmer until the fruit is soft enough to easily crush with a spoon, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice and sugar to the fruit mixture and let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Reserving the cooking liquid, strain out the fruit and place in a blender.</li>
            <li>Process until very smooth, then add the saved cooking liquid along with 2 more cups water and the rosewater if desired.</li>
            <li>Stir to combine and chill before serving.</li>
