        A good juice

    <p>
        Don't get your cranberries out of a can this year! This delicious, tangy sauce is good 
        enough to be eaten on its own, but also makes a fantastic spread for turkey sandwiches. 
        Try spooning some on a slice of toast and then melting cheese over the top. 
        You will never buy canned jelly ever again.
