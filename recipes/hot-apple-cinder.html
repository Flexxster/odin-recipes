    <title>Hot Apple Cinder/title>
</head>
<body>
    his delicious holiday treat is almost effortless to make and much tastier than anything from a package. Try mixing with cranberry juice for a tangy festive punch.

1 gallon apple juice (unfiltered if possible)
1 orange
12 whole cloves
12 whole allspice
2 large sticks cinnamon, or 4 small
Brown sugar to taste
Brandy (optional)
Pour the apple juice into a large pot. Break the cinnamon sticks into small pieces and bundle with the other spices into a mesh ball or a cheesecloth bag. Slice up the orange, peel and all, and add both it and the spice bag to the pot. 

Bring to a boil, and then simmer for ten minutes (or longer; but keep in mind that the cloves will make the drink bitter if left too long). Strain out the spices and orange, then sweeten with brown sugar if needed. 

Pour into mugs and serve. Add a little bit of brandy if you like.
